why @ I am into self learning and I have learnt php, python, javascript, html & css (I know the syntax, I am not a programmer yet since 5-6 years when I started and i never developed a single program). but what i feel is all the courses teach the syntax not the programing or development. In other words they just give the receipe and list of ingridient but never cook the food in real or maybe they do but they do not connect the dots. In their understanding they think that its easy to understand but as a beginner its all confusing (and I firmly believe programming is easy). its confusing maybe all because now the development involves different layer of technologies. and each technology is being taught seperately and i think it is the major root of evil.

my approach @ Now its time to nail it.
     Just think old school web development. it was all html and inline styling no css(I assume). when markup and styling got seperated by different files still both run in the same lane together in terms of learning we learn them parallel. To be precise courses are designed which binds them together.
     Then after we was introduced with dynamic tecnologies. and they all comes with different languages and syntax and this is the major barrier. server technolgies are different, on the top programming languages are different and then database language are different and html, css is always there.
     
     The development in javascript is the rescue which comes with the field force in every layer of technologies. So what i feel it should be the primary language of learning together with html and css.
