why @ I am into self learning and I have learnt php, python, javascript, html & css (I know the syntax, I am not a programmer yet since 5-6 years when I started). but what i feel is all the courses teach the syntax not the programing or development. In other words they just give the receipe and list of ingridient but never cook the food in real or maybe they do but they do not connect the dots
