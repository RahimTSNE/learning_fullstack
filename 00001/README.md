(first thing first- this is comment syntax that doesn't be seen in actual page on the client side
this is how i think a courese should be structure and I am starting to learn with that precise structrue.


the first thing that should be taught is form.


@ things to keep in mind as a programer.
1. users just don't watch a web page, they interact, they provide some data to a page, they get some data from a page
2. form is the best choice to learn those interaction.
3. form uses all the layer of web. form interact with the server, with the database, with the user (client)
4. so at first i will learn markup(html) of form then styling(css) of form then server and database interactions.
<code>
<form name="" action="" enctype="" autocomplete>
  <fieldset>
    <legend> any data</legend>
    <p>
      <label>any data</label>
      <input type= "text" name="" id="" value="" class="" placeholder="" />
      <input type= "password" name="" id="" value="" class="" placeholder="" />
      <input type= "submit" name="" id="" value="" class="" placeholder="" />
      <input type= "tel" name="" id="" value="" class="" placeholder="" />
      <input type= "num" name="" id="" value="" class="" placeholder="" />
     <p>
    <fieldset>
 </form
      
</code>
